<p>I at some point compiled a list of questions to ask myself while working on a project or listening to a presentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the broad economic question that we are trying to answer?</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the broadest domain where this question or problem resides.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What is the narrowed down version of economic question that we are trying to study?</li>
</ol>
<p>Since any economic question will have a lot of moving parts and becuase all the complex effects can&rsquo;t be taken into account simultaneously, to drive the core idea we must focus on a narrower question within this. Here the idea is to state a one sentence version of what exactly is being studied.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What are some of the existing explanations and why do you think they are not sufficient?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here it is important not to get lost in details and just focus on the broad idea or explaination, sort of the key point and mechanism proposed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Whats my creative take on the question/problems?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is basically your proposed creative solution or explaination.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-work-on-the-project-">How to work on the project ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a commitment to finish the project, no matter how bad it turns out to be. My understand is that one can keep looking for <em>good</em> ideas forever. Ex-ante it is very difficult to know what will work and what won&rsquo;t, so the best strategy is to commit to finish no matter what. Some of those will be some won&rsquo;t, thats the way it is.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I recently found some advise on similar lines.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>i. A new “fact”. Using some micro data source, document some pattern that (to the best of your
knowledge) hasn’t been shown before. This could be a correlation, a new regression result, a difference in means of some variable across groups, etc., and tell us a story for why this fact might be interesting.
This doesn’t necessarily need to be cleanly identified causal evidence, but you should think about these
types of things in interpreting your findings and whether they are likely to be interesting. The goal is not
to have the makings of a full empirical paper by the end of the course, but instead to get your “hands
dirty” working with data and trying to think about what we might learn from it.</p>
<p>ii. A new theoretical point: Using a model related to the topics discussed in this class, either
studied analytically or using the computer, make a theoretical point that you find interesting. This could
be a mechanism through which policy works or shocks transmit in the economy, or a trade-off that might
shape what optimal policy could look like. Again, the goal is not to have the makings of a full applied
theory paper, but to delve into a question you find interesting and get experience building a framework to
study it.</p>
<p>iii. A “virtual paper”: this should be a slightly more cohesive proposal for a paper, but it need not
have any empirical, theoretical, or quantitative results yet. But it should have a clearly defined question
and proposed way of answering it.</p>
